        "p1": "Top Gun: Maverick, the sequel to the ’80s classic Top Gun starring Tom Cruise, will now premiere on November 19th, according to Deadline. It was previously slated to open on July 2nd — which itself was a delay from December 23rd, 2020.",
        "p2": "Maverick’s delay is the latest shift in this summer’s movie slate, which, like last summer’s, has been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney delayed Black Widow from a May release date to July 9th and is also opting to make it available as a $30 Disney Plus Premier Access title the same day. The company also made Pixar’s Luca a Disney Plus exclusive and said Cruella will be a Disney Plus Premier Access release when it hits theaters on May 28th. MGM delayed No Time to Die, the next James Bond movie, from April 2nd to October 8th.",
        "p3": "Universal Pictures also shifted the highly anticipated F9 from Memorial Day weekend to June 25th, which would make it the first major blockbuster to exclusively release in theaters since Christopher Nolan’s Tenet last fall — assuming Universal doesn’t follow its competition and delay the upcoming Fast & Furious film again.",
        "p4": "The Top Gun sequel’s delay has cascading effects on the rest of Paramount Pictures’ movie lineup. Two other movies starring Cruise have been bumped: Mission: Impossible 7 is now debuting on May 27th, 2022, instead of this November, while Mission: Impossible 8 has moved from a November 2022 release to July 7th, 2023, according to Deadline. Dungeons and Dragons has also been delayed, moving to a March 3rd, 2023, debut. Paramount’s announcement also referenced an as-yet unrevealed Star Trek film — which io9 reports is a secret, J.J. Abrams-produced project — set to hit theaters on June 9th, 2023."

        "p1": "You could hardly accuse the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies of being safe – the films that took Marvel fully cosmic, with sentient flora and fauna among its core cast. But with The Suicide Squad, writer-director James Gunn is fully unleashed, crossing over his wild comic book visuals with the darker-edged likes of Super and Slither for a colourful, violent, unexpected summer blockbuster. That meant not only drawing together a line-up of bizarre characters from the annals of the DC Comics vault – including Idris Elba’s Bloodsport, the Sylvester Stallone-voiced King Shark, Daniela Melchior’s Ratcatcher 2 and David Dastmalchian’s Polka Dot Man, rubbing shoulders with Margot Robbie’s established fan-favourite Harley Quinn – but doing whatever he pleased with them.",
        "p2": "“On The Suicide Squad I could just go anywhere I wanted to go,” Gunn tells Empire in the upcoming new issue, available to pre-order now with five collectible The Suicide Squad covers. “I mean, Marvel really lets me have a lot of freedom, but I’m still making a PG-13 movie. So I just loved the whole no-holds-barred approach of being able to make this enormous movie – with no rules!” From choosing which elements remain from 2016’s Suicide Squad (Viola Davis’ Amanda Waller returns, as do Jai Courtney’s Captain Boomerang and Joel Kinnaman’s Rick Flag) to hand-picking giant alien starfish Starro as the villain, Gunn was given free reign. “He’s said this was the most fun he’s ever had making a movie, and that joy bled into the entire production,” says producer Peter Safran. “It was a joyful experience, because it’s really an unedited version of James Gunn.”",
        "p3": "In true Gunn style, the visuals are a clash of influences – his purposefully mismatched Squad seeing dorky comics costumes sit alongside sleeker, more practical get-ups. “I liked the idea of these disparate aesthetics, as if you’re bringing in each of these characters from a different movie or TV show,” he explains. “So Peacemaker is from a 1970s TV show; Bloodsport is more of a modern, scary, grimdark character; Ratcatcher 2 is from some Saw horror film; Javelin looks ridiculous; Savant is kind of cool, but also kind of Def Leppard in the wrong ways; and Harley is Harley! And they’re thrown together in this sort of natural, real world that we present with Corto Maltese, which is very grounded.”",
        "p4": "Get a full look at Gunn’s wild vision for The Suicide Squad in the new issue of Empire, on sale Thursday 8 July – also featuring Gunn’s seven key lessons from a decade and a half of filmmaking, interviews with his regular collaborators, an exclusive Gunn-picked playlist, the very first look at Peacemaker, and much more. The Suicide Squad comes to UK cinemas from 30 July."

        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixZc90cnhgM",
        "p1": "It’s officially official: MGM has been bought by Amazon, and for a cool $8.45 billion at that. With an eye on revamping legacy properties, and more than likely upping their original content output for Prime Video, some may be wondering what this could mean for the future of the James Bond franchise. Well, if you needed any confirmation that No Time To Die, or any other 007 film, will still be coming to a theater near you, longtime series producer Barbara Broccoli has just had the final say on such a matter.",
        "p2": "In a statement to Variety, Broccoli firmly doubled down on the fact that No Time To Die will make its debut at the movies. And her official word also serves as notice for those who would think that the James Bond series could go the way of other spies like Without Remorse’s John Clark or Jack Ryan. The future of 007’s theatrical presence is, according to Barbara Broccoli, the following:'We are committed to continuing to make James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.'",
        "p3": "However, that’s not the only hurdle that No Time To Die will have to clear on its potential road to the Prime Video library. On top of EON Productions confirming that the cinematic release of the film is secure, there’s some recent developments that will see the 25th James Bond adventure on another platform for some time. Thanks to a recent deal made with Paramount, pay cable network Epix will have first dibs on No Time To Die’s afterlife, followed by a stop at Paramount+.",
        "p4": "There’s one plus side to all of this wheeling and dealing between MGM and Amazon: there’s now a potential permanent streaming home for the legacy entries in the James Bond collection. So instead of trying to track down which streamer has which movies, and worrying about which ones are free with ads, the entire library might find itself in one convenient location. Though, we’ll have to wait to hear word on whether or not any other existing deals stand in the way of such a happening. In the meantime, No Time To Die will hit theaters on September 30th in the UK and October 8th in the US, just as nature intended."

        "p1": "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings could change the way people view Marvel movies, according to the film’s writer. While all eyes are currently on the long-awaited Black Widow (releasing in theaters and on Disney+ July 9), the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed Shang-Chi will soon follow in early September. The film was originally announced at Comic-Con in 2019, along with a slew of other MCU titles that were all subsequently impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "p2": "With Simu Liu in the titular role and Awkwafina as his sidekick Katy, Shang-Chi will be Marvel’s first blockbuster to star a predominantly Asian and Asian-American cast. Following the notorious fake-out in Iron Man 3, the film will also introduce the real Mandarin as its main antagonist: Wenwu (Tony Leung), Shang-Chi’s father. The Phase 4 film recently made waves with a new trailer that aired in primetime and provided a few takeaways. Michelle Yeoh will be playing a new character named Jiang Nan, despite appearing as Aleta Ogord in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Based on the trailer, Abomination from 2008’s Incredible Hulk is also back.",
        "p3": "As Callaham touches on above, Shang-Chi is not just a milestone moment for the MCU because of its increased representation, but because of its alternative take on superhero action. In the past, Marvel’s most famous action set pieces, such as the Avenger’s final showdown with Thanos in Endgame, have heavily relied on green screens and CGI. With Shang-Chi as its primary protagonist, known in the comics as the Master of Kung Fu, the film will feature more martial arts-based action.",
        "p4": "Taking inspiration from various martial arts classics like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Shang-Chi required its stars like Liu to get in superb shape and perform many of their own stunts, especially since their faces aren’t covered by masks like many of their MCU counterparts. As Marvel’s first martial arts-based movie, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings will surely alter some preconceived notions about what a superhero blockbuster can be."

        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrwBnlYOp4g",
        "p1": "Tom Hardy is the face of Sony’s “Venom” franchise, but he’s more than just the star of the upcoming sequel “Venom: Let There Be Carnage.” As confirmed by screenwriter Kelly Marcel in an interview with Empire magazine, Hardy is getting the first “story by” credit of his feature film career after “spending months” brainstorming the narrative for the sequel with Marcel. “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” reunites Hardy and Michelle Williams opposite franchise newcomer Woody Harrelson as the eponymous villain.",
        "p2": "As reported by Empire: “While Marcel gets the full screenplay credit, her script sprang from lengthy conversations with Hardy where they hashed out how exactly Venom and chaotic red symbiote Carnage (which attaches itself to Woody Harrelson’s serial killer Cletus Kasady) will collide on screen. ‘He doesn’t get a pen and write,’ explains Marcel of Hardy’s process. ‘We spent months breaking the story together on FaceTime, riffing on ideas, seeing what worked, seeing what didn’t. Then I took everything we spoke about and holed up somewhere for three months quietly, knocking out a script.'”",
        "p3": "The original “Venom” script was written by Marcel, Jeff Pinkner, and Scott Rosenberg, with a “story by” credit given to Pinker and Rosenberg. Marcel gets sole screenwriting credit on the sequel, which has a lot of expectations to live up to after the first movie became a strong box office force with $856 million worldwide.",
        "p4": "“Venom: Let There Be Carnage” finds Andy Serkis in the director’s chair for his fourth feature, with his catalog of films including “Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle” from 2018 and the romance “Breathe” from 2017. Serkis is a motion capture legend thanks to his work on “The Lord of the Rings,” “King Kong,” and “Planet of the Apes.” Criticisms were mainly flung at the original “Venom” for its CGI — which requires Tom Hardy to be blended with the technology — so it stands to reason that Serkis will more fluidly integrate motion capture graphics into real-world settings than the first film did. Still, details on the film’s tech have been under wraps."

        "p1": "Get ready for jungle-themed puns and Disneyland references as the Jungle Cruise movie finally hits theaters in July 2021, starring Disney favorites Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson and Emily Blunt. Here's everything we know about the Amazon adventure so far. Because of delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Disney's Jungle Cruise is scheduled for release on July 30, after being put off for more than a year. It'll launch in theaters and via paid Premier Access on Disney Plus on that day, and will be made available to all Disney Plus subscribers three months later for no extra fee. Until it's more widely available, accessing the movie in Premier Access will cost an additional $30 on top of your monthly Disney Plus bill.",
        "p2": "The Jungle Cruise movie is based on the Disneyland ride of the same name. Johnson plays a boat skipper named Frank, who takes Blunt's character Lily and her brother McGregor on a mission to find a tree that has magical healing powers. (McGregor is played by British stand-up comedian Jack Whitehall, who you may recognize from the Good Omens series on Amazon Prime.) The journey will see them fight wild animals and compete against a rival German expedition, with Disney adding that there will be a 'supernatural element.' To celebrate a month until the movie's release, Disney on June 30 launched two new trailers: One from The Rock and one from Blunt, each making their own character the star of the movie. A trailer dropped in late May, showing off Jesse Plemons' submarine-captaining villain.",
        "p3": "It's no surprise that Disney is going after another ride-based movie, after the success of its Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. The Jungle Cruise is even older than the Pirates ride -- it was the only attraction to exist in Adventureland on Disneyland's opening day in 1955. The Jungle Cruise attraction features a boat ride through a man-made jungle, with each tour led by a skipper who follows a pun-filled script. The boat travels past crocodiles, piranhas, monkeys, elephants, rhinos, cannibals, hippos and of course the infamous back side of water, the eighth wonder of the world.",
        "p4": "As he prepared for the movie, Johnson said on Instagram, Disney's Imagineers let him see the original Jungle Cruise concept art from the 1950s, as well as giving him an 'oral/visual history lesson behind the iconic ride and its infamous and relentlessly entertaining skippers.' The ride is currently being overhauled at both Disneyland and Disney World to include new scenes and remove out-of-date cultural depictions. It's set to reopen at Disneyland on July 16, in time for the movie's release."

        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/g7q60i_Lh_E",
        "p1": "Ryan Reynolds finally plays Deadpool again... for a new video reacting to the latest Free Guy trailer alongside the MCU's Korg. X-Men Origins: Wolverine aside, Reynolds' portrayal of Deadpool has been a fan favorite ever since he revived the character for 2016's solo movie and gave him the foul-mouthed, fourth wall-breaking onscreen depiction he deserved. Both Deadpool and its sequel were hits, and eyes soon turned to a third movie. After Disney bought Fox in 2019, though, there was some uncertainty over whether Deadpool 3 would actually be able to happen. Currently, the project is in development at Marvel Studios and is planning to take place within the MCU.",
        "p2": "In the meantime, Reynolds has turned his attention to other projects. This includes the much-delayed Free Guy, which will finally arrive in theaters next month. Reynolds stars as Guy, an affable NPC in a video game who one day is made aware of the simulated reality of his surroundings. In order to save his home from complete destruction, Guy must team up with outside player Molotov Girl (Jodie Comer) and discover the hero inside of himself.",
        "p3": "In his latest promotional effort for Free Guy, Reynolds suits up as Deadpool once more to give his opinion on the action-comedy's most recent trailer. He's joined by Korg (Taika Waititi), the fan favorite MCU character from Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame. In a way, that makes this Deadpool's first MCU outing. Check out the video below.",
        "p4": "Waititi also stars in Free Guy, so it's fitting that he brought out his Marvel character to help promote the film alongside Reynolds. The two previously starred in the much-criticized Green Lantern together, something they conveniently forgot the last time they promoted Free Guy. This collaboration appears to suit them much better, and it's paved the way for numerous MCU jokes. For example, Deadpool references the franchise's Disney+ shows, at one point asking Korg if he has one himself. The highlight just might be Deadpool asking for advice about how to join the MCU."

The debut of this alien superteam movie was pushed back a year due to the pandemic, but the first Eternals trailer landed in May and revealed that they've been secretly living on Earth for a very long time indeed. The movie is directed by Chloé Zhao, who won a pair of Oscars for her film Nomadland, and is written by cousins Matthew and Ryan Firpo. Eternals is set for release on Nov. 5.",
        "p2": "They're the next superpowered group to join the MCU. Marvel Studios has assembled an incredible cast -- including Angelina Jolie, Kit Harington and super-buff Wolverine cosplayer Kumail Nanjiani -- to fill out the team. The official synopsis describes the Eternals as 'ancient aliens who have been living on Earth in secret for thousands of years.' 'Following the events of Avengers: Endgame, an unexpected tragedy forces them out of the shadows to reunite against mankind's most ancient enemy, The Deviants,' it reads. After the trailer dropped, fans wondered how the Eternals could remain in hiding through the various catastrophes that have befallen MCU Earth, spawning some delightful memes on social media.  ",
        "p3": "The character descriptions are from Marvel's official synopsis -- poor Dane Whitman is apparently too boring for any hype. However, he becomes sword-wielding hero Black Knight in the comics, so maybe the company is just keeping that quiet. The movie will reunite Harington and Madden, who played Jon Snow and Robb Stark in Game of Thrones. 'It never crossed my mind to be in a Marvel movie. I guess that I thought that boat had sailed, and it was an absolute shock,' Salma Hayek said in a May 2021 interview with Variety. She also told the publication that she was one of the first ones cast for the movie.",
        "p4": "Gemma Chan was previously seen in the MCU as Captain Marvel's Minn-Erva, but Sersi is a separate character. She said working on Eternals was a very different experience than on Captain Marvel, which employed more studio work and blue screen. Eternals was filmed in the Canary Islands and England, so it uses real environments and mostly natural lighting, as previously reported by IDMbrief. In December 2019, Nanjiani revealed the fruits of his training -- and the intense regime required to maintain it -- to play swordsman Kingo in some super-buff Instagram shots. (He famously used that new physique to pose as Wolverine (replacing Hugh Jackman) and other iconic movie characters for a Men's Health March 2020 photoshoot.)"

        "p1": "By this point, it’s more than evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a massive effect on the film industry. Film productions were forced to pause, leading to studios to delay a number of high-profile movies in the process. This includes Sony’s Spider-Man spinoff, Morbius, which was first slated to hit theaters during the summer of 2020. The Jared Leto-led film has since shifted spots in both 2021 and 2022 and, now, the movie has received another slight delay. Most recently, Morbius was scheduled to be released on January 21, 2022, but another delay has caused the film to be shifted back one week to January 28, per IGN. The move comes around a time that Sony is continuing to shift its films into positions to succeed at the box office.",
        "p2": "The news may be somewhat disappointing for some fans who have been waiting anxiously to see the latest installment in Sony’s Spider-Man adjacent franchise. However, a one-week delay is nothing compared to the months of shuffling that the movie was previously faced with. Morbius isn’t the only Sony/Marvel film to experience delays due to the ongoing pandemic. Venom: Let There Be Carnage was originally set for release on October 2, 2020. The movie was later shifted to June 2021 before moving back to September 17. Just recently, the highly anticipated supervillain sequel received a one-week delay just as Morbius did.",
        "p3": "So far, fans have only been treated to one trailer for Morbius, but it seemed to be enough to get fans excited for the comic book adaptation. The film centers on the titular Michael Morbius, a scientist who suffers from a rare blood disease. In his attempts to cure himself, he afflicts himself with a form of vampirism, which gives him both superhuman abilities and all of the weaknesses that come with being a vampire. Jared Leto is joined in the film by Matt Smith, Adria Arjona, Jared Harris and Tyrese Gibson. The superhero flick definitely seems to be going for a horror vibe, and you can check out the trailer for yourself down below:",
        "p4": "But aside the creepy motif, it looks like the film could indeed have some key Spider-Man connections. The biggest is arguably the inclusion of Michael Keaton, who previously played the role of Adrian Toomes/The Vulture in Spider-Man: Homecoming. While Keaton isn’t confirmed to be playing Toomes at this time, some still believe this could hint at a larger, live-action multiverse. Unfortunately, fans still have to wait some time before they can learn the answers to some of Morbius’ biggest questions. Still, they can find solace in the fact that this latest delay won’t push things back too far. Let’s hope the film is well worth the wait."
