        "p1": "Top Gun: Maverick, the sequel to the ’80s classic Top Gun starring Tom Cruise, will now premiere on November 19th, according to Deadline. It was previously slated to open on July 2nd — which itself was a delay from December 23rd, 2020.",
        "p2": "Maverick’s delay is the latest shift in this summer’s movie slate, which, like last summer’s, has been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. Disney delayed Black Widow from a May release date to July 9th and is also opting to make it available as a $30 Disney Plus Premier Access title the same day. The company also made Pixar’s Luca a Disney Plus exclusive and said Cruella will be a Disney Plus Premier Access release when it hits theaters on May 28th. MGM delayed No Time to Die, the next James Bond movie, from April 2nd to October 8th.",
        "p3": "Universal Pictures also shifted the highly anticipated F9 from Memorial Day weekend to June 25th, which would make it the first major blockbuster to exclusively release in theaters since Christopher Nolan’s Tenet last fall — assuming Universal doesn’t follow its competition and delay the upcoming Fast & Furious film again.",
        "p4": "The Top Gun sequel’s delay has cascading effects on the rest of Paramount Pictures’ movie lineup. Two other movies starring Cruise have been bumped: Mission: Impossible 7 is now debuting on May 27th, 2022, instead of this November, while Mission: Impossible 8 has moved from a November 2022 release to July 7th, 2023, according to Deadline. Dungeons and Dragons has also been delayed, moving to a March 3rd, 2023, debut. Paramount’s announcement also referenced an as-yet unrevealed Star Trek film — which io9 reports is a secret, J.J. Abrams-produced project — set to hit theaters on June 9th, 2023."

        "p1": "You could hardly accuse the Guardians Of The Galaxy movies of being safe – the films that took Marvel fully cosmic, with sentient flora and fauna among its core cast. But with The Suicide Squad, writer-director James Gunn is fully unleashed, crossing over his wild comic book visuals with the darker-edged likes of Super and Slither for a colourful, violent, unexpected summer blockbuster. That meant not only drawing together a line-up of bizarre characters from the annals of the DC Comics vault – including Idris Elba’s Bloodsport, the Sylvester Stallone-voiced King Shark, Daniela Melchior’s Ratcatcher 2 and David Dastmalchian’s Polka Dot Man, rubbing shoulders with Margot Robbie’s established fan-favourite Harley Quinn – but doing whatever he pleased with them.",
        "p2": "“On The Suicide Squad I could just go anywhere I wanted to go,” Gunn tells Empire in the upcoming new issue, available to pre-order now with five collectible The Suicide Squad covers. “I mean, Marvel really lets me have a lot of freedom, but I’m still making a PG-13 movie. So I just loved the whole no-holds-barred approach of being able to make this enormous movie – with no rules!” From choosing which elements remain from 2016’s Suicide Squad (Viola Davis’ Amanda Waller returns, as do Jai Courtney’s Captain Boomerang and Joel Kinnaman’s Rick Flag) to hand-picking giant alien starfish Starro as the villain, Gunn was given free reign. “He’s said this was the most fun he’s ever had making a movie, and that joy bled into the entire production,” says producer Peter Safran. “It was a joyful experience, because it’s really an unedited version of James Gunn.”",
        "p3": "In true Gunn style, the visuals are a clash of influences – his purposefully mismatched Squad seeing dorky comics costumes sit alongside sleeker, more practical get-ups. “I liked the idea of these disparate aesthetics, as if you’re bringing in each of these characters from a different movie or TV show,” he explains. “So Peacemaker is from a 1970s TV show; Bloodsport is more of a modern, scary, grimdark character; Ratcatcher 2 is from some Saw horror film; Javelin looks ridiculous; Savant is kind of cool, but also kind of Def Leppard in the wrong ways; and Harley is Harley! And they’re thrown together in this sort of natural, real world that we present with Corto Maltese, which is very grounded.”",
        "p4": "Get a full look at Gunn’s wild vision for The Suicide Squad in the new issue of Empire, on sale Thursday 8 July – also featuring Gunn’s seven key lessons from a decade and a half of filmmaking, interviews with his regular collaborators, an exclusive Gunn-picked playlist, the very first look at Peacemaker, and much more. The Suicide Squad comes to UK cinemas from 30 July."

        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixZc90cnhgM",
        "p1": "It’s officially official: MGM has been bought by Amazon, and for a cool $8.45 billion at that. With an eye on revamping legacy properties, and more than likely upping their original content output for Prime Video, some may be wondering what this could mean for the future of the James Bond franchise. Well, if you needed any confirmation that No Time To Die, or any other 007 film, will still be coming to a theater near you, longtime series producer Barbara Broccoli has just had the final say on such a matter.",
        "p2": "In a statement to Variety, Broccoli firmly doubled down on the fact that No Time To Die will make its debut at the movies. And her official word also serves as notice for those who would think that the James Bond series could go the way of other spies like Without Remorse’s John Clark or Jack Ryan. The future of 007’s theatrical presence is, according to Barbara Broccoli, the following:'We are committed to continuing to make James Bond films for the worldwide theatrical audience.'",
        "p3": "However, that’s not the only hurdle that No Time To Die will have to clear on its potential road to the Prime Video library. On top of EON Productions confirming that the cinematic release of the film is secure, there’s some recent developments that will see the 25th James Bond adventure on another platform for some time. Thanks to a recent deal made with Paramount, pay cable network Epix will have first dibs on No Time To Die’s afterlife, followed by a stop at Paramount+.",
        "p4": "There’s one plus side to all of this wheeling and dealing between MGM and Amazon: there’s now a potential permanent streaming home for the legacy entries in the James Bond collection. So instead of trying to track down which streamer has which movies, and worrying about which ones are free with ads, the entire library might find itself in one convenient location. Though, we’ll have to wait to hear word on whether or not any other existing deals stand in the way of such a happening. In the meantime, No Time To Die will hit theaters on September 30th in the UK and October 8th in the US, just as nature intended."

        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/8YjFbMbfXaQ",
        "p1": "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings could change the way people view Marvel movies, according to the film’s writer. While all eyes are currently on the long-awaited Black Widow (releasing in theaters and on Disney+ July 9), the Destin Daniel Cretton-directed Shang-Chi will soon follow in early September. The film was originally announced at Comic-Con in 2019, along with a slew of other MCU titles that were all subsequently impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.",
        "p2": "With Simu Liu in the titular role and Awkwafina as his sidekick Katy, Shang-Chi will be Marvel’s first blockbuster to star a predominantly Asian and Asian-American cast. Following the notorious fake-out in Iron Man 3, the film will also introduce the real Mandarin as its main antagonist: Wenwu (Tony Leung), Shang-Chi’s father. The Phase 4 film recently made waves with a new trailer that aired in primetime and provided a few takeaways. Michelle Yeoh will be playing a new character named Jiang Nan, despite appearing as Aleta Ogord in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Based on the trailer, Abomination from 2008’s Incredible Hulk is also back.",
        "p3": "As Callaham touches on above, Shang-Chi is not just a milestone moment for the MCU because of its increased representation, but because of its alternative take on superhero action. In the past, Marvel’s most famous action set pieces, such as the Avenger’s final showdown with Thanos in Endgame, have heavily relied on green screens and CGI. With Shang-Chi as its primary protagonist, known in the comics as the Master of Kung Fu, the film will feature more martial arts-based action.",
        "p4": "Taking inspiration from various martial arts classics like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Shang-Chi required its stars like Liu to get in superb shape and perform many of their own stunts, especially since their faces aren’t covered by masks like many of their MCU counterparts. As Marvel’s first martial arts-based movie, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings will surely alter some preconceived notions about what a superhero blockbuster can be."

        "hero": "https://i.imgur.com/OfMGGfD.jpg",
        "image": "https://i.imgur.com/BhsLZc5.jpg",
        "trailer": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrwBnlYOp4g",
        "p1": "Tom Hardy is the face of Sony’s “Venom” franchise, but he’s more than just the star of the upcoming sequel “Venom: Let There Be Carnage.” As confirmed by screenwriter Kelly Marcel in an interview with Empire magazine, Hardy is getting the first “story by” credit of his feature film career after “spending months” brainstorming the narrative for the sequel with Marcel. “Venom: Let There Be Carnage” reunites Hardy and Michelle Williams opposite franchise newcomer Woody Harrelson as the eponymous villain.",
        "p2": "As reported by Empire: “While Marcel gets the full screenplay credit, her script sprang from lengthy conversations with Hardy where they hashed out how exactly Venom and chaotic red symbiote Carnage (which attaches itself to Woody Harrelson’s serial killer Cletus Kasady) will collide on screen. ‘He doesn’t get a pen and write,’ explains Marcel of Hardy’s process. ‘We spent months breaking the story together on FaceTime, riffing on ideas, seeing what worked, seeing what didn’t. Then I took everything we spoke about and holed up somewhere for three months quietly, knocking out a script.'”",
        "p3": "The original “Venom” script was written by Marcel, Jeff Pinkner, and Scott Rosenberg, with a “story by” credit given to Pinker and Rosenberg. Marcel gets sole screenwriting credit on the sequel, which has a lot of expectations to live up to after the first movie became a strong box office force with $856 million worldwide.",
        "p4": "“Venom: Let There Be Carnage” finds Andy Serkis in the director’s chair for his fourth feature, with his catalog of films including “Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle” from 2018 and the romance “Breathe” from 2017. Serkis is a motion capture legend thanks to his work on “The Lord of the Rings,” “King Kong,” and “Planet of the Apes.” Criticisms were mainly flung at the original “Venom” for its CGI — which requires Tom Hardy to be blended with the technology — so it stands to reason that Serkis will more fluidly integrate motion capture graphics into real-world settings than the first film did. Still, details on the film’s tech have been under wraps."
